# appendagehtm
appendage.htm is a little starter file I thought is great for people to actually memorise how to create. This took me two days of labour, others will take alot less time.

It's something that I think should be kept lying around the internet, for the sake of  nostalgia.

Found the technique to utilising the file.

  a:-First thing todo is too press tab and blur out of the first load.
  b:-Type your code...
      The code that you type is in a constant refresh, the browser will not render the objects into XML space yet.
      Once your happy with what you have made;
  c:-Press the refresh button on your browser. The entire document is now in XML space and not doing a constant reload.
  
  c(caveat):-Press the refresh button after (a) , and you can keep everything in XML ready to save.
  
why coding in refresh mode is handy?

I do-not know, but whatever this snippet is, it is well worth the practise to understand how to start a web framework from scratch and begin writing out code without the need of anyother help other than the ability to write to the local disc.
